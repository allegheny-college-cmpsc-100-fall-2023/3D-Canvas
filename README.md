# 3D Canvas Lab
## Getting started with VPython

## Description

In this lab, you'll be drawing a semi-intricate 3D image of your own design on VPython's 3D canvas. This image should be composed of at least 15 VPython shapes, and should be carefully considered. We will be adding on to this lab in Week 2, so read the instructions carefully to plan your lab accordingly. 

In the first week of working on this assignment, you should use at least five variables in crafting your image, and each of these variables should be deployed at least twice (for example, when you want two or more shapes to be the same size, or to have the same position along one or more axes). 

Each of these variables should have multiple possible values that lead to a viable image (similar to the starter code we used in the Helix Variations exercise). We'll expand on this during the second week. 

You have until 8pm on September 17 to complete this assignment in full. Next week, we will add more parameters to the assignment, including color. Don't add any color yet during week 1. 

## Week 1 Steps

### Steps 1-4 | Ideation

This is your first opportunity to get an <b>ideation</b> checkmark for a lab assignment. To receive an ideation point, complete all of the steps below. Also note that you have a chance in this lab to get a check for <b>independent research</b>, so you can think if there are any VPython tools we haven't covered in class that you want to use in this assignmet. 

You can find complete VPython documentation near the top of the syllabus, under "Resources."

1. <b>Brainstorm</b> the professor will set a timer for brainstorming. During the five minutes of brainstorming, think about 3D images you could build out of cubes, spheres, and pyramids. You can also use text, and are welcome to do so especially if you love writing or wordplay -- but you still want to place the text intentionally in the 3D space.  Write down every and any idea that comes to mind. If you took your brainstorm on paper, take a photo and paste it under Step 1 in IDEATION.md. If you took your notes on your computer, copy and paste them in. 
2. Look at what you've come up with and circle anything that draws you. Why is it appealing? What does the image you imagine feel like? Is there anything it reminds you of? Jot down some notes on these questions. Put your notes under Step 2 in IDEATION.md
3. Choose one of your ideas to execute for your assignment, and then find a picture online that you can refer as you mold the aesthetic for your canvas. Save the link to the image, and write a few sentences about the qualities of the image you want to reference in your assignment. (You don't want to copy anything exactly, but rather use the reference for inspiration). Put your image and what you've written under Step 3 in IDEATION.md
4. Referencing the work you've done in Step 1-3, write a more polished paragraph about the 3D image you plan to create, what you want it to look and feel like, and how you'll take inspiration from your reference image. Also write about the shapes you will use to make the image, and how will you use variables. If your plan changes, that's okay, but I want to see that you've put in some forethought. 

### NEXT STEPS: Get coding!

Now that you've made a plan, you can get to work creating the image you've imagined, or something else that grows out of that imagining! 

This assignment is an opportunity to get your first checkmark for <b>variables</b>. In order to receive checks toward coding objectivse, you should label those objectives near the top of your assignment.  

More instructions will be added for our second week on this assignment, in addition to more autograding parameters. 

To get started, login to Trinket.io and create a new trinket. Choose VPython for the Trinket type and then select the Python option.
