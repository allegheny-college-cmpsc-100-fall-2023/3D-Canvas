# Helix Variations

In this assignment, you will start to get your feet wet with VPython and 3D rendering. You'll see how little changes can make big differences in an image. You'll also have a chance to think about how you want an animation to look or feel, and to make coding choices to create the intended effect. 

## Instructions 

1. Sign into your [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/) account
2. Find the starter code at [this link](https://trinket.io/glowscript/4e40208104). Hit the "Remix" button on the upper right ot make your own copy. 
3. Read the instructions in the green comments and follow along. Try changing one line of code at a time and running the results in between each change, so you can see what the code changes are doing to the animation.
4. Now, take a minute and see if you can come up with a vision for how you want to change the animation. Is there a certain feeling or image you want to evoke? What could you do with variables such as color and speed to create the desired effect?
5. Change the code some more to see if you can get the animation closer to what you imagined in #4. Even getting a little bit closer is a win at this stage. 
6. Check to make sure each choice you made is at least a little different from the starter code, so that you pass the grader. You can reference the starter code by toggling the "remix" button. 
7. When you are done, hit Save (to the left of the remix button). 
8. Click the share-tree button near the top-left, then click "Link" and copy your link. 
9. Paste the link from step 5 into the LINK.md file in this repo by clicking the filename (above), clicking the pencil to edit, and commiting your changes with the green "Commit" button on the upper right
10. You have completed the exercise! You'll be able to see autograding by refreshing this page and following the professor's instructions.
