# 3D Canvas Lab
## Getting started with VPython

## Description

In this lab, you'll be drawing a semi-intricate 3D image of your own design on VPython's 3D canvas. This image should be composed of at least 15 VPython shape (e.g. sphere, box, pyramid, text, or other shpes you research independently), and should be carefully considered. 

In the first week of working on this assignment, you should use at least three string or number variables in crafting your image, and each of these variables should be deployed at least twice. For example, you could use a variable to create two or more shapes that are the same size, or to have the same X, Y, or Z coordiantes. You could also have a scale variable that applies to shape dimensions, or a string variable for text you want to repeat. (These are just a few options, but there are others — you're welcome to use your imagination)!

In week two, you will add colors to assignment. You should have at least two color values that you store in variables, and each of these should be deployed at least twice. 

These variables should have multiple possible values that lead to a viable image (similar to the starter code we used in the Helix Variations exercise). In week two, you'll have at least one of these variables determined by user input. 

You have until 8pm on September 17 to complete your first attempt in full, and then you will have one chance to revise.

In this lab, you'll have opportunities to get checks for ideation, independent research, reflection, and variables. You can get points for ideation and reflection by populationg IDEATION.md and REFLECTION.md as instructed. 

## Some notes on Gatorgrade

This is probably most of your first semester working with Github Classroom and Gatorgrade. It's also MY first semester working with Github Classrom and Gatorgrade!

The first time deploying someting in real life is usually a bit rocky, so I appreciate all of you bearing with me. You can always let me know if you think the software has graded you unfairly (even the best functioning bots make mistakes sometimes). 

Note that autograde will run when I update the assignment, and I might make multiple passes. This will lead to a build fail because there will be new grading parameters I haven't outlined yet i.e. please ignore any build fails from commits I make. If Github notifcations are stressing you out, you are welcome to [silence them](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications). 

### PART ONE: Ideation Steps

This is your first opportunity to get an <b>ideation</b> checkmark for a lab assignment. To receive an ideation point, complete all of the steps below. Also note that you have a chance in this lab to get a check for <b>independent research</b>, so you can think if there are any VPython/Python tools we haven't covered in class that you want to use in this assignment. Independent research is an optional part of this assignment. 

<b>Feel free to include drawings in any of the steps below! </b>

1. <b>Brainstorm</b> the professor will set a timer for brainstorming. During the five minutes of brainstorming, think about 3D images you could build out of cubes, spheres, and pyramids. You are also welcome to use 3D text, especially if you love writing or wordplay. Just make sure you still make use of the 3D properties of the canvas.  Write down every and any idea that comes to mind. If you did your brainstorm on paper, take a photo and paste it under Step 1 in IDEATION.md. If you took your notes on your computer, copy and paste them in. 
2. Look at what you've come up with and circle or highlight anything that draws you. Why is it appealing? What does the image you imagine feel like? Is there anything it reminds you of? Jot down some notes on these questions. Put your notes under Step 2 in IDEATION.md
3. Choose one of your ideas to execute for your assignment, and then find a picture online that you can refer as you mold the aesthetic for your canvas. Save the link to the image, and write a few sentences about the qualities of the image you want to reference in your assignment. (You don't want to copy anything exactly, but rather use the reference for inspiration). Put your image and what you've written under Step 3 in IDEATION.md
4. Referencing the work you've done in Step 1-3, write a more polished paragraph of 150+ words about the 3D image you plan to create, what you want it to look and feel like, and how you'll take inspiration from your reference image. Write something about why this choice is compelling to you. Also inlcludes some techinical planning about the shapes you will use to make the image, and how will you use variables. If your plan changes, that's okay, but I want to see that you've put in some forethought. Paste your writing under STEP 4 in IDEATION.md. 
5. Draw something of your own that you can reference as you create the image. It can be a digital drawing or a photo of something you've drawn on paper. It can be intricate or it can be a crude sketch — just something visual to get you started. Paste the drawing under STEP 5 in IDEATION.md. 



### PART TWO: Get coding!

Now that you've made a plan, you can get to work creating the image you've imagined, or something else that grows out of that imagining! 

This assignment is an opportunity to get your first checkmark for <b>variables</b>. You also have the opportunity to get an independent reserach checkmark in this assignment. 

To get that point for variables, use at least three <b>string</b> or <b>number</b> variables in the assignment, and deploy each one at each twice. <strong>WEEK TWO UPDATE: In addition, you will use at least two variables to store colors, and deploy each of these at least twice. You will also have at least one of your string, number, or color variables assigned using user input.</strong> (Note that you can comment out the input line and replace it with a standard variable assignment while testing, so you don't get the popup everytime you run the program)

Use code comments to document your variable assignments and deployments — at least one comment for each assignment and each deplooyment. You can look at [this demo](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/b21ce9cf3f) for an example of how you might do this. 

In addition to the string or number variables detailed above, you will want to create variables for your shapes so that you can manipulate them once you've created them. 

For now, err on the side of over-documenting your code rather than explaining too little. I recommend having a comment for each line of code that explains what it is doing! This is required for your variables assignments and deployments to get a check, but I recommend doing it for other code as well. Professionals tend to be a bit more spare in their comments, but right now additional commenting helps us to absorb what we are learning. 

To get an Independent Rsearch checkmark, you should use VPython and/or Python code we haven't covered in class (see [Coding References](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-fall-2023/course-materials#coding-references) on the syllabus). You should mark the section of code that you've independently researched with the comment label #INDEPENDENT RESEARCH, and you should explain what each line of the newly-learned code is doing in the comments. You should also include a link the the source code you're referencing, and an acknowledgment if you've borrowed any codeblocks more than two lines long (even if you've modified them -- mark your modifications in the comments). You need to get two checkmarks for independent resarch throughout the duration of the semester in order to receive credit, so it's up to you whether you feel ready to do that work now, or if you want to save it for a later assignment. 

To get started, login to Trinket.io and create a new trinket. Choose VPython for the Trinket type and then select the Python option. Make sure to save your work often! 

When you are ready, you will add a link to your trinket to the LINK.md file. There's no requirement to update LINK.md before the deadline, but if you want to run the autograder intermitently, you can do so by updating the file.


### PART THREE: Reflection

In order to get a "reflection" checkmark for this lab, write at least two hundred words inside "REFLECTION.md" in which you reflect on your technical and artistic goals and accomplishments with this lab. You will also consider the strengths and weaknesses of Python itself. To receive credit, your response should address each of the following bullet points.

- In what ways did this project meet the goals set out in IDEATION.md? 
- What would you do to further achieve these goals if you had more time?
- How did the aesthetic decisions you made affect how the project looks, feels, and exists in the world? You can talk about how it decisions that will remind the viewer of something familiar (e.g. if you used white cursive on a red background to trigger thoughts of Coca-Cola and commerce), colors that evoke a certain image or feeling (i.e. blue for calm/the ocean), a crowded canvas that evokes joyful chaos, a minimal chaos that evokes spartan calm, etc. The options are endless and these are just some examples to reference for inspiration, not to copy. I want to see your original thoughts. 
- How did working on this project change your skills as a coder?
- When it comes to Python and VPython, do you feel the language and library are well-designed? Is there anything that could change to make the language more effective?
