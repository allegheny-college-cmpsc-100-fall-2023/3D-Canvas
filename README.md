# 3D Canvas Lab
## Getting started with VPython

## Description

In this lab, you'll be drawing a semi-intricate 3D image of your own design on VPython's 3D canvas. This image should be composed of at least 15 VPython shape (e.g. sphere, box, pyramid, text, or other shpes you research independently), and should be carefully considered. We will be adding on to this lab in Week 2, so read the instructions carefully to plan your lab accordingly. 

In the first week of working on this assignment, you should use at least three variables in crafting your image, and each of these variables should be deployed at least twice. For example, you could use a variable to create two or more shapes that are the same size, or to have the same X, Y, or Z coordiantes. You could also have a scale variable that applies to shape dimensions. (These are just a few options, but there are others — you're welcome to use your imagination)!

Each of these variables should have multiple possible values that lead to a viable image (similar to the starter code we used in the Helix Variations exercise). We'll expand on this during the second week. 

You have until 8pm on September 17 to complete this assignment in full. Next week, we will add more parameters to the assignment, including color. Don't add any color yet during week 1, but plan your lab knowing you'll add in color later. 

In this lab, you'll have opportunities to get checks for ideation, independent research, reflection, and variables. You can get points for ideation and reflection by populationg IDEATION.md and REFLECTION.md as instructed (reflection instructions will be available in the second week of working on this assignment). 

## Some notes on Gatorgrade

This is probably most of your first semester working with Github Classroom and Gatorgrade. It's also MY first semester working with Github Classrom and Gatorgrade!

The first time deploying someting in real life is usually a bit rocky, so I appreciate all of you bearing with me. You can always let me know if you think the software has graded you unfairly (even the best functioning bots make mistakes sometimes). 

NOte that autograde will run when I update the assignment for next week, and I might make multiple passes. This will lead to a build fail because there will be new grading parameters I haven't outlined yet i.e. please ignore this build fail. If Github notifcations are stressing you out, you are welcome to [silence them](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications). 

## Week 1 Steps

### PART ONE: Ideation Steps

This is your first opportunity to get an <b>ideation</b> checkmark for a lab assignment. To receive an ideation point, complete all of the steps below. Also note that you have a chance in this lab to get a check for <b>independent research</b>, so you can think if there are any VPython/Python tools we haven't covered in class that you want to use in this assignment. Independent research is an optional part of this assignment. 

<b>Feel free to include drawings in any of the steps below! </b>

1. <b>Brainstorm</b> the professor will set a timer for brainstorming. During the five minutes of brainstorming, think about 3D images you could build out of cubes, spheres, and pyramids. You can also use text, and are welcome to do so especially if you love writing or wordplay -- but you still want to place the text intentionally in the 3D space.  Write down every and any idea that comes to mind. If you took your brainstorm on paper, take a photo and paste it under Step 1 in IDEATION.md. If you took your notes on your computer, copy and paste them in. 
2. Look at what you've come up with and circle anything that draws you. Why is it appealing? What does the image you imagine feel like? Is there anything it reminds you of? Jot down some notes on these questions. Put your notes under Step 2 in IDEATION.md
3. Choose one of your ideas to execute for your assignment, and then find a picture online that you can refer as you mold the aesthetic for your canvas. Save the link to the image, and write a few sentences about the qualities of the image you want to reference in your assignment. (You don't want to copy anything exactly, but rather use the reference for inspiration). Put your image and what you've written under Step 3 in IDEATION.md
4. Referencing the work you've done in Step 1-3, write a more polished paragraph of 150+ words about the 3D image you plan to create, what you want it to look and feel like, and how you'll take inspiration from your reference image. Write something about why this choice is compelling to you. Also inlcludes some techinical planning about the shapes you will use to make the image, and how will you use variables. If your plan changes, that's okay, but I want to see that you've put in some forethought. Paste your writing under STEP 4 in IDEATION.md. 
5. Draw something of your own that you can reference as you create the image. It can be a digital drawing or a photo of something you've drawn on paper. It can be intricate or it can be a crude sketch — just something visual to get you started. Paste the drawing under STEP 5 in IDEATION.md. 



### PART TWO: Get coding!

Now that you've made a plan, you can get to work creating the image you've imagined, or something else that grows out of that imagining! 

This assignment is an opportunity to get your first checkmark for <b>variables</b>. You also have the opportunity to get an independent reserach checkmark in this assignment. 

To get that point for variables, use at least three variables in the assignment, and deploy each one at each twice. Use code comments to document your variable assignments and deployments — at least one comment for each assignment and each deplooyment. You can look at [this demo](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/b21ce9cf3f) for an example of how you might do this.

For now, err on the side of over-documenting your code rather than explaining too little. I recommend having a comment for each line of code that explains what it is doing! This is required for your variables assignments and deployments to get a check, but I recommend doing it for other code as well. Professionals tend to be a bit more spare in their comments, but right now additional commenting helps us to absorb what we are learning. 

To get an Independent Rsearch checkmark, you should use VPython and/or Python code we haven't covered in class (see [Coding References](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-fall-2023/course-materials#coding-references) on the syllabus). You should mark the section of code that you've independently researched with the comment label #INDEPENDENT RESEARCH, and you should explain what each line of the newly-learned code is doing in the comments. You should also include a link the the source code you're referencing, and an acknowledgment if you've borrowed any codeblocks more than two lines long (even if you've modified them -- mark your modifications in the comments). You need to get two checkmarks for independent resarch throughout the duration of the semester in order to receive credit, so it's up to you whether you feel ready to do that work now, or if you want to save it for a later assignment. 

More instructions will be added for our second week on this assignment, in addition to more autograding parameters. 

To get started, login to Trinket.io and create a new trinket. Choose VPython for the Trinket type and then select the Python option. Make sure to save your work often! 

When you are ready, you will add a link to your trinket to the LINK.md file. There's no requiremetn to update LINK.md before the deadline, but if you want to run the autograder intermitently, you can do so by updating the file.
